      <h2>What is TigerPawCode?</h2>

      <p>TigerPawCode was created as a cathartic excercise when I was diagnosed with Severe Dyslexia. I intended on
        sharing my personal experiences and daily challenges in hope it will help others in a similar position.</p>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      <p>I am a Web Developer of nearly 10 years so the majority of my experiences will be in relation to development
        but I hope that my experiences will resonate with anyone, no matter who they are and what their career path may
        be.
      </p>

      <h2>Dyslexia</h2>

      <p>Now the first thing I need to mention is that when I was first diagnosed with very severe dyslexia, I thought
        it was impossible as literacy is something I am very confident with, to the point that people #ask me for
        spelling advice but the truth is...<b>Dyslexia is much wider than literacy</b>.
      </p>

      <p>So, how does it affect me?</p>

      <p>Without going into too much detail just yet, the main issues I have are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understanding & processing information.</li>
        <li>Memory - both short and long term.</li>
        <li>Struggle to plan and organise.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I realise that it doesn't sound like they are that much of an issue but the reality is that it affects me
        greatly in many facets of my life. In terms of being a web developer it makes me feel like an imposter 90% of
        the time which leaves me with very low confidence.</p>

      <p>I constantly second guess myself, I have to look up simple code snippets that I should remember but just
        can't, I worry about colleagues asking me questions as I won't remember the answers off the top of my head and
        in an industry where you have to constantly learn it can be a real struggle...for example...I have been trying
        memorize the SOLID principles for years but if you asked me what they are this very second, I will probably
        only remember 3(at most!).</p>

      <h2>It's not all bad news though</h2>

      <p>I have found this condition helps drive me, motivate me and push me to work harder and harder. Ultimately, if
        I didn't put in the work and I wasn't passionate about what I do then I wouldn't be able to do it.</p>

      <p>Don't get me wrong, I often have days where I think I should look for an easier line of work but then I also
        have days where I feel completely rewarded and feel like I have exceeded my own harsh expectations.</p>
